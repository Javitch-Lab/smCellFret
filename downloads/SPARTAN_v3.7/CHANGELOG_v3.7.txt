SUMMARY: batchKinetics is the focus of this release, including implementations 
  of two key algorithms in QuB directly in Matlab: MIL and MPL. Existing methods
  are faster, more robust, and support new features like degenerate states and
  basic constraints.


GETTRACES:
 - Save imaging profile geometry in fileMetadata. This enables later display
     of the movie with properly separated subfields.

 - New MovieViewer class for easily viewing movies from the console and
     enabling movie display from other programs (sorttraces).

 - MovieMontage menu option to play movies simulatanously while tiled side-by-side
     for direct comparison. Particularly useful for comparing photobleaching.


SORTTRACES:
 - Use MovieViewer class for movie display and separate subfields
     while highlighting current molecule location. Enables playing the movie.

 - Context menus for each bin for exporting for Origin.


HMM (batchKinetics):
 - Baum-Welch: optimizations, code simplification, make calling conventions
     similar to other optimizers. Implement forward-backward algorithm as a 
     MEX function (using Eigen) that is ~10-times faster than Matlab code.
     Obtain final rate constants from logm(A) instead of A/dt, which is much
     more accurate. Support for degenerate states.

 - MPL: maximum point likelihood parameter optimizer that optimizes rate constants
     directly (instead of transition probabilities as in Baum-Welch), which
     enables support for constraints, dead-time corrections, etc.

 - MIL: now implemented directly in Matlab instead of calling a QuB library.
     Unlike QuB, we use fmincon on the likelihood function with analytical
     partial derivatives only. Includes support for constraints, dead-time
     corrections, etc. Excludes contribution of final dwell *time* in the dark
     state, which aids in convergence.

 - Baum-Welch and ebFRET ignore excluded traces.

 - ebFRET returns 'average' model rates and FRET stdev. All parameters now come
     from the optimized prior distribution instead of averaging the posteriors.
     No longer need to restart batchKinetics when adding ebFRET to path.

     *** Add zero-FRET noise to traces so all have a defined zero state.
         This should be a setting in future versions...

 - batchKinetics: show intermediate results and waitbar updates with all methods,
     display statehist, TD, and dwell time plots in main GUI panel.

 - QubModelViewer: support for constraining rates, which are grayed out, one
     unified dialog for changing state and class model parameters. Doubling-
     clicking on a state brings up this dialog for easier access.

 - QubModel: enable saving models as .mat format files with the .model extension.
     This avoids the legacy baggage of the .qmf format, which is still supported.

 - simulate: separate parameters for donor and acceptor bleaching and an option
     to simulate exact times instead of exponentially distributed. Specify SNR
     instead of background noise stdev. Restore option to return simulated
     dwell-time series. Remove total intensity scaling when using gamma scaling.
     Additional code cleanup.

 - Various: take QubModel object as input instead of individual parameters,
     support for degenerate states.

 - statehist: use QubModel colors for consistency.


GLOBAL:
 - Various other bug fixes.
